# Movies-Database-Web-App

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Movies API, Modal, Pagination, MongoDB

This app is a client-side interface for accessing movie data from a Movies API. It provides a searchable table that displays a subset of movie data, including columns for Year, Title, Plot, Rating, and Run Time. When a user clicks on a specific movie in the table, a modal window is shown with additional information such as the movie's poster (if available), director, full plot, cast, awards, and IMDb rating. 

The app uses Bootstrap for styling and incorporates a pagination control to allow users to navigate through the pages of movie data. It also includes a generic modal window container for displaying movie details dynamically.
